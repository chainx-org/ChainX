//! Common concepts with regard to the ChainX Mining system, particularly the user-level ones.
//!
//! There are two approaches of mining in ChainX:
//!
//! 1. As a PoS-based blockchain, **Staking** is inherently the fundamental way of mining.
//! In this way, users(stakers) nominate some validators with some balances locked, earning
//! the staking reward.
//!
//! 2. One goal of ChainX is to embrace more the eixsting cryptocurrencies into one ecosystem,
//! therefore **Asset Mining** is introduced for winning more external assets like BTC, ETH, etc.
//! For example, Bitcoin users can deposit their BTC into ChainX, then they'll get the X_BTC
//! in 1:1 and the mining rights in ChainX system accordingly, earning the new minted PCX
//! like the stakers in Staking.
//!
//! Both of these two approaches share one same rule when calculating the individual reward, i.e.,
//! **time-sensitive weight calculation**.
//!
//! ```
//! Amount(Balance) * Duration(BlockNumber) = Weight
//! ```
//!
//! For Staking:
//!
//! ```
//! staked_balance(Balance) * time(BlockNumber) = vote_weight
//! ```
//!
//! All the nominators split the reward of the validator's jackpot according to the proportion of vote weight.
//!
//! For Asset Mining:
//!
//! ```
//! ext_asset_balance(Balance) * time(BlockNumber) = ext_mining_weight
//! ```
//!
//! All asset miners split the reward of asset's jackpot according to the proportion of asset mining weight.
