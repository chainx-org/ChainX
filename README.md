❗️ To avoid distractions and move quickly, we make the hard choice of developing ChainX in a private codebase. Once it's been fully tested and audited with great care, we'll put it public again. Stay tuned!

## Introduction

For the time being the goal of [ChainX](https://github.com/chainx-org/ChainX) is to build a cross-chain digital asset management platform on the strength of [substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) which is next-generation framework for blockchain created by [paritytech](https://github.com/paritytech). The long-term vision of ChainX is to evolve as a general blockchain infrastructure platform.

ChainX is still at a very early stage and in an active development. The instruction as followed is not stable and may change in the future.

## Features

- Built-in light client of existing blockchains.

- Built-in Coin DEX.

- Progressive staking and election machanism.

- And more.

## Roadmap

### 1.0: Independent Chain

ChainX 1.0 will operate as an independent chain at the very beginning, supporting the Coin DEX between the system currency PCX and BTC powed by BTC cross-chain transaction from the relay. At this stage, ChainX will continue to relay BCH, LTC, ZEC, ETH, DAI, ERC20, ERC721, ADA, EOS and other chains for Coin DEX.

### 2.0: Polkadot Parachain

ChainX 2.0 will begin at Q3 2019 when Polkadot releases v1. It will connect into Polkadot and transform into a para-chain, adding new applications such as decentralized stable currency collateralized by BTC and derivatives exchanges.

### 3.0: Polkadot level 2 multi-chain system

ChainX 3.0 will begin at 2020 when Polkadot releases v2, splited into a multi-chain architecture operating as Polkadot's level 2 relay network.
